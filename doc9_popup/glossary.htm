							      then Newnham Priory, it may have lapsed for a time after Newnham
							      Priory was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1540. In 1552 the townspeople
							      of Bedford petitioned Edward VI for a licence to receive and hold
							      lands to enable the teaching of grammar in the town. The letters
							      patent were granted in August 1552 and the refounded school was

							    <p class="bodytext">The disbanding and destruction of religious houses in England and
							      Wales under Henry VIII. In 1536 the religious establishments with
							      annual incomes of less than &pound;200 per annum were dissolved. The attention
							      of Henry and his chief minister Thomas Cromwell turned to the friaries
							      in 1537, and thereafter to the rest of the religious houses. By
							      1540 they had all gone, the last to fall being Waltham Abbey in
							      Essex. Their lands, properties and incomes went to the Crown. Some
							      of the monastic buildings remained in religious use – Henry allowed
							      some monasteries to be refounded as secular cathedrals served by
							      dean and chapter instead of priors and monks, and in rare cases
							      the church buildings, or parts of them, were bought by locals to
							      act as the parish church. Generally however the properties and lands
							      were simply sold off to wealthy lay people, with the Court of Augmentations
							      set up to deal with the spoils.</p>

							      Arthur died in 1502, making Henry heir to the throne, to which he
							      succeeded on 21 April 1509. Desperate for a male heir to secure
							      the Tudor succession, Henry VIII had six wives. During the English
							      Reformation Henry became head of the Church in England, repudiating
							      papal supremacy, and closed down the monasteries. The monastic lands
							      were sold off and the revenues went to the Crown. Henry died at
							      Whitehall in London on 28 January 1547, and was buried in St George's
							      Chapel in Windsor Castle.</p>

							      remodelled and combined into one work by 1540. Referred to simply
							      as Lily's <em>Short Introduction of Grammar</em>, it became the
							      official Latin grammar text book and used in schools throughout
							      England. Shakespeare was familiar with it and quotes sentences from
							      it in certain of his plays. </p>

							      he developed Presbyterian leanings. Having accepted the religious
							      settlement of Elizabeth I, he was appointed dean of St Paul's, London,
							      in 1560. Nowell is believed to have composed his Catechism in c.1549
							      but early in the reign of Elizabeth I, he wrote a longer catechism
							      to serve as a statement of Protestant principles, which was printed
							      in 1570.</p>

                                  business purposes. It is a cursive style (from
                                  the Latin 'currere' - to run) so called because
                                  it was written at speed and 'runs' across the
                                  page. The pen does not leave the page between
                                  letters. The use of secretary hand had begun
