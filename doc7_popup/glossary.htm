							      and detail, but could include information on the boundaries of the
							      manor, details of the extent of each property, the customs of the
							      manor and the rental. Surveys were often made upon change of ownership
							      of the manor, or in order to try to discover ways in which the yield
							      of the manor could be increased. They provided for the lord of manor
							      a written record of the obligations owed to him by tenants but also

							      of Denmark. Charles ascended the throne on 27 March 1625. With his
							      wife Henrietta Maria of France he had four sons including the future
							      Charles II and James II, and five daughters. Disputes and confrontations

							    <p class="bodytext">Rentals began to appear in England in the 14th century, but in
							      Wales they are rare before the beginning of the 16th century. They
							      are often the longest part of the manorial survey. They often include
							      a list of the tenants' names, details of land they hold, the form
							      of tenure by which it was held, the use to which it was put (for
							      example, arable, pasture), the amounts of rent due each year (usually
							      at Lady Day and Michaelmas) and the services the tenants owed the
							      lord of the manor. The person actually occupying the property might
							      have been a sub-tenant however, and therefore their name might not
							      appear on the list. A rent roll was a list of rents paid rather

								  <a name="Tenure" id="Tenure"></a>
									<h2 class="redanddots">Tenure</h2>
							    <p class="bodytext">The conditions under which the land rented from the lord of the
							      manor is held. There were three kinds of tenure in the manor of
							      Manorbier and Penally: freehold and two types of customary or copyhold,
							      i) husbandry hold, which was equivalent to copyhold of inheritance,
							      and ii) censory hold, which was equivalent to copyhold for one lifetime.</p>
								  <a name="Yard" id="Yard"></a>
							    <h2 class="redanddots">Yard</h2>
							    <p class="bodytext">An area of land which would vary in size according to the locality.
