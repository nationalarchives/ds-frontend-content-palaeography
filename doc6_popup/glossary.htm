                                <p class="bodytext"> The Court of Augmentations was one of a number
                                  of financial courts established during the
                                  reign of Henry VIII. It was founded in 1536
                                  to administer monastic properties and revenues
                                  confiscated by the crown at the Dissolution
                                  of the Monasteries. The court had its own chancellor,
                                  treasurer, lawyers, receivers and auditors. </p>
                                <p class="bodytext"> In 1547 the Court of Augmentations was amalgamated
                                  with the Court of General Surveyors, which
                                  had been established in 1542 to administer
                                  crown lands. In 1554, the roles of the Courts
                                  of Augmentations, General Surveyors, and First
                                  Fruits and Tenths were taken over by the Exchequer.</p>

                                  houses in England and Wales under Henry VIII.
                                  In 1536 the religious establishments with annual
                                  incomes of less than £200 per annum were dissolved.
                                  The attention of Henry and his chief minister
                                  Thomas Cromwell turned to the friaries in 1537,
                                  and thereafter to the rest of the religious
                                  houses. By 1540 they had all gone, the last
                                  to fall being Waltham Abbey in Essex. Their
                                  lands, properties and incomes went to the Crown.
                                  Some of the monastic buildings remained in
                                  religious use – Henry allowed some monasteries
                                  to be refounded as secular cathedrals served
                                  by dean and chapter instead of priors and monks,
                                  and in rare cases the church buildings, or
                                  parts of them, were bought by locals to act
                                  as the parish church. Generally however the
                                  properties and lands were simply sold off to
                                  wealthy lay people, with the Court of Augmentations
                                  set up to deal with the spoils.</p>

                                <p class="bodytext"> Windsor Forest. Although
                                  today the word 'forest' conjures up an image
                                  of trees, in law a forest was an area of land,
                                  usually belonging to the monarch, which was
                                  set apart for the hunting of wild animals and
                                  game. This land could be wooded in part, but
                                  would have also consisted of heathland and
                                  pasture. </p>
                                <p class="bodytext">Windsor Forest was created by William the
                                  Conqueror (1066-1087) as a deer park. It consisted
                                  of land stretching from the fence of the Great
                                  Park of Windsor Castle to the Loddon River,
                                  approximately 18 miles (c. 29 km). Within these
                                  bounds forest law prevailed. Killing a deer
                                  without permission invoked severe punishments.
                                  The keeper of Windsor Forest was the constable
                                  of Windsor Castle. The land was sold off by
                                  Parliament during the Civil War. By the time
                                  of Charles II, the remains of Windsor Forest
                                  consisted of nine separated areas of woodland.</p>

                                  1491. He was the second son of Henry VII and
                                  Elizabeth of York. His elder brother Prince
                                  Arthur died in 1502, making Henry heir to the
                                  throne, to which he succeeded on 21 April 1509.
                                  Desperate for a male heir to secure the Tudor
                                  succession, Henry VIII had six wives. During
                                  the English Reformation Henry became head of
                                  the Church in England, repudiating papal supremacy,
                                  and closed down the monasteries. The monastic
                                  lands were sold off and the revenues went to
                                  the Crown. Henry died at Whitehall in London
                                  on 28 January 1547, and was buried in St George's
                                  Chapel in Windsor Castle.</p>

                                  The abbey was dedicated to the Virgin Mary
                                  and St John the Evangelist. It was richly endowed
                                  by Henry I (1100-1135) and given the possessions
                                  of the abolished abbeys of Leominster and Chelsea.
                                  Henry also presented Reading Abbey with its
                                  prized relic, the hand of St James the Apostle.
                                  Henry I was buried there in 1135. In 1164 the
                                  abbey was consecrated by Thomas a Becket, and
                                  it hosted the wedding of John of Gaunt and
                                  Blanche of Lancaster in 1359. </p>

                                  9 1/4 d. Its last abbot, Hugh Cook of Faringdon,
                                  was executed as a traitor outside the abbey
                                  gateway in 1539, and the abbey fell to the
                                  king. Part of the monastic buildings were retained
                                  as a royal residence for a while, but the church
                                  buildings were gradually stripped. </p>

                                  by Henry I (1100-1135). When the abbey was

                                  £1000. Southwell's brother Robert also held
