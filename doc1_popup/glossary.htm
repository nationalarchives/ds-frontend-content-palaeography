                                  of Sudeley, held the post of Lord High Admiral
                                  of England from 1547 to 1549. The brother of
                                  Jane Seymour and uncle of Edward VI, he strove
                                  to gain a share of the power and authority
                                  enjoyed by his elder brother, Edward Seymour
                                  the Protector. Immediately after the death
                                  of Henry VIII in 1547, Thomas sought the hand
                                  of the Princess Elizabeth but this was refused.
                                  A few months later, he secretly married Henry’s
                                  widow Catherine Parr. Following Catherine’s
                                  death in childbirth the following year, Thomas
                                  again sought to marry Princess Elizabeth. Once
                                  more he was refused and Thomas received warnings
                                  about his conduct. He was summoned to an interview
                                  with the Protector but refused to attend. In
                                  January 1549 he was arrested and sent to the
                                  Tower. The bill of attainder against him was
                                  passed in February, his execution being held
                                  on 20 March 1549 on Tower Hill. He was buried
                                  within the Tower.</p>

                                  Elizabeth I was the daughter of Henry VIII
                                  and Anne Boleyn. She was born at Greenwich
                                  on 7 September 1533. Elizabeth was extremely
                                  well-educated and was fluent in six languages.
                                  As princess, she became a focus for Protestant
                                  opposition during her half-sister Mary's reign
                                  and as such was briefly held prisoner in the
                                  Tower of London. Elizabeth came to the throne
                                  on 17 November 1558. She is said to be one
                                  of England's most popular monarchs. Elizabeth
                                  never married and died at Richmond Palace on
                                  24 March 1603. She was buried at Westminster

                                  Mary I, a devout Roman Catholic, was the daughter
                                  of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. She
                                  was born at Greenwich Palace on 8 February
                                  1516. She ascended the throne on 19 July 1553,
                                  aged 37 years, after the death of her half-brother
                                  Edward VI. Mary restored Roman Catholicism
                                  to England. She was given the nickname ‘Bloody
                                  Mary' for the persecution of Protestants -
                                  up to 300 Protestants being burnt in three
                                  years. On 25 July 1554, Mary married Philip
                                  who became the king of Spain in 1556. The marriage
                                  and the persecution of Protestants made Mary
                                  unpopular, and her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth
                                  became a focus for rebellion. Mary died childless
                                  on 17 November 1558 and was succeeded by Elizabeth.
                                  Mary was buried at Westminster Abbey.</p>

                                    the brother of Henry VIII's third wife Jane
                                    Seymour and uncle of King Edward VI, was
                                  one of the most powerful nobles in the kingdom.
                                    He was one of the executors of the will of
                                    Henry VIII. Seymour's actions immediately
                                  after the death of Henry in 1547 have been
                                  described as a &quot;coup d'etat&quot;. Henry's death
                                  was kept secret for several days, during which
                                  time Edward took charge of the new young king,
                                  having himself declared Protector of the Realm
                                  and Protector of the King's Person. Seymour
                                  immediately began to introduce radical Protestant
                                  reform in England. </p>
                                <p class="bodytext">In 1548, Edward's position
                                  was threatened by the intrigues of his younger
                                    brother Thomas, who was keen to share in
                                  Edward Seymour's power. Edward reluctantly
                                  assented to the bill of attainder against his
                                  brother, who was executed on Tower Hill in
                                  March 1549. In October 1549, Edward Seymour
                                  was himself sent to the Tower when the tide
                                  of political intrigue turned against him. He
                                  was deposed from the protectorate in January
                                  1550. Although freed in the following month,
                                  Seymour was rearrested in 1551 and was returned
                                  to the Tower after further plots against him.
                                  He was beheaded on Tower Hill in January 1552.

                                <p class="bodytext"> The Tower of London was
                                  begun in the reign of William the Conqueror
                                  (1066-1087), with successive monarchs including
                                  Henry VII, the grandfather of Mary I and Elizabeth
                                  I, making further additions. From the 1530s,
                                  the Tower housed many religious and political
                                  prisoners including Sir Thomas More and Anne
                                  Boleyn, Elizabeth I's mother, who was accused
                                  of treason and executed at the Tower with her
                                  brother and others in 1536. Catherine Howard,
                                  Henry VIII's fifth wife, met her end there
                                  in 1542, as did Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset
                                  in 1552 and Lady Jane Grey, the ‘nine days'
                                  queen' in 1554. Elizabeth I was imprisoned
                                  in the Tower for three months in 1554. </p>

                                    Tower of London was also used to store important
                                    official records. Large quantities of records
                                    were stored in the White Tower - above a
                                  store of gunpowder. From the early 17th century
                                  visitors could visit the Tower and consult
                                  the records for a fee. During the 19th century
                                  the records were taken to the new Public Record
                                  Office in Chancery Lane in London. These can
                                  now be consulted at The National Archives at
                                  Kew.</p>

                                  traitor Wiat' document 1, line 45. The
                                  son of the English poet, Sir Thomas Wyatt the
                                  Elder, Thomas Wyatt the Younger was said to
                                  be of a ‘wild and impulsive temperament' ( <em>Dictionary
                                  of National Biography </em>).
                                  In the spring of 1554, he organised an insurrection
                                  against Queen Mary. Known as 'Wyatt's
                                  Rebellion',
                                  this followed the announcement of Queen Mary's
                                  plan to marry Philip, the future king of Spain.
                                  Wyatt had supposedly received a vague promise
                                  of help from the French ambassador and led
                                  a force of 4000 men to London. He reached as
                                  far as Ludgate before his forces began to desert,
                                  a circumstance that forced him to surrender.
                                  Wyatt was committed to the Tower of London
                                  and sentenced to death for high treason. He
                                  was beheaded on 11 April 1554, after having
                                  fully exonerated Princess Elizabeth. </p></td>
