              England began officially on 25 March (Lady Day), and not 1 January
              (even though this was when New Year’s Day was celebrated).</p>
            <p class="bodytext">Thus the year number did not change until 25

          <p class="mainbodytext"> So if you see a document dated any time between
            January and 24 March before 1752, be aware that in modern terms,
            you need to add a year. In publications you may see this written
            as January 1750/51, the year as it was known at the time / the
            year as we know it now. This is also known as OS (Old Style) and
            NS (New Style).</p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">The Calendar Act 1752 brought about further changes. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII had reformed the calendar, then in use, known as the Julian Calendar (named after Julius Caesar). The Julian Calendar did not correspond exactly to the solar year. The new Gregorian Calendar cut 10 days from the year in adjustment. Other Catholic countries followed and adopted the Gregorian Calendar but England, being Protestant, did not. England therefore remained 10 days behind  the New Style Calendar. By 1752 England was some 11 days behind  other European countries. So in 1752 these days had to be cut out of the year to make the adjustment. Therefore Wednesday 2 September 1752 was followed immediately by Thursday 14 September.</p>
          <p class="mainbodytext"> In Scotland, 1 January became the official
          beginning of the year in 1600, the day after 31 December 1599.</p>
          <h3 class="bigblack">Regnal Years</h3>
          <p class="mainbodytext"> Some documents will be dated not by the calendar
            year but by the regnal year - how long the ruling monarch had been
            on the throne. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">‘1 Elizabeth I’ means the first year of the
            reign of Elizabeth I. Elizabeth I came to the throne on 17 November
            1558, so 1 Elizabeth I means some time between 17 November 1558
            and 16 November 1559.</p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">Watch out for documents written in the reign
            of Charles II. Although he came to the throne in May 1660, after
            the Commonwealth period, he actually calculated his regnal
            year as beginning on 30 January 1649, the date of the execution of
            his father Charles I. So documents written in the first year that
            Charles II was <em>genuinely</em> on the throne would actually be styled 12
            Charles II. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">For more information about dates (including
            saints days, regnal years, religious festivals and terms of the
            law courts) see C.R. Cheney and M. Jones (eds), ‘A Handbook
            of Dates: For Students of British History’ (Cambridge University
            Press, revd 2000).</p>

          <p class="mainbodytext"> Arabic numerals were not used in England until
            the 16th century, and even after then Roman numerals continued to
            be used.</p>
          <p class="mainbodytext"> Most people today are still familiar with
            the classic Roman numerals. Be aware, however, that you will find
            them represented in a slightly different way in documents written
            in English. In particular, the lower case was used. A ‘1’ by itself,
            or at the end of a number, was usually represented by a ‘j’.</p>

          <p class="mainbodytext"> Money was calculated in pounds, shillings
            and pence.</p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">One pound = 20 shillings. The pound was represented
            either by ‘li’, or &pound;: transcribe both with a &pound; sign before
            the amount given. This symbol is actually an elaborate ‘L’, from
            the Latin ‘libra’, meaning pound. Compare the symbol for about a
            pound in weight, which is represented by ‘lb’ - it comes from the
            same. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext"> One shilling = 12 pennies. A shilling was
            represented by ‘s’, originally short for ‘solidos’, a Roman coin. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext"> One penny = two halfpennies, or four farthings.
            A penny was represented by ‘d’, short for ‘denarius’, a Roman coin. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">One halfpenny = 2 farthings. A halfpenny was
            represented by ‘ob’, short for ‘obolus’, a Roman coin. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">One farthing = a quarter of a penny. A farthing
            was represented by ‘qua’, short for ‘quadrans’. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">A 4d coin was called a groat. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext"> There was also an amount of money known as
            a mark. A mark was not an actual coin, but an amount. It was worth
            two-thirds of a pound, that is 13s 4d. Half a mark (one-third of
            a pound) was therefore 6s 8d. </p>
          <p class="mainbodytext">When transcribing documents that mention amounts
            of money, do not expand the abbreviations such as li, ob, etc. Leave
            them abbreviated, and remember to transcribe li as ‘&pound;’. They were never written out in full.</p>

          <p class="mainbodytext">Confusion arises from the fact that a perch
            is also a measurement of length. A perch, pole and rod are all terms
            for a measurement of length of approximately 5 metres (5.5 yards).
            For further information about measurement see Colin Chapman, ‘How
              heavy, how much and how long?: weights, money and other measures
            used by our ancestors’ (Lochin,1995). </p>
