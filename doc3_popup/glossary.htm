								<h2 class="redanddots">Armada</h2>
                                <p class="mainbodytext">Armada is the Spanish word for a fleet of
                                  ships. The Spanish Armada of 1588 was made
                                  up of approximately 150 ships. King Philip
                                  II of Spain intended to invade England and
                                  bring it under Spanish rule. There were many
                                  reasons behind this, both religious and political.
                                  Since Philip had been married to Mary I, he
                                  had been king of England for a few years. Under
                                  Elizabeth, England had reverted from the Catholic
                                  rule of Philip and Mary to Protestantism. Elizabeth
                                  I was also encouraging unrest in the Netherlands,
                                  which were ruled by Philip. Further provocation
                                  was provided by her refusal to condemn the
                                  English privateers who were attacking Spanish
                                  ships. England was also competing with Spain
                                  for trade and expansion in the New World or
                                  Americas. The execution of Mary Queen of Scots
                                  in 1587 brought matters to a head, and the
                                  Armada set out to invade England the following
                                  year. Unfortunately for Philip, bad storms
                                  meant that the Spanish ships were unable to
                                  meet up with the forces of the Duke of Parma
                                  in the Netherlands as originally intended.
                                  They were also blown off course after the Battle
                                  of Gravelines. Intending to return to Spain
                                  by sailing north around Scotland, many ships
                                  were in fact wrecked off the coast of Ireland
                                  and Scotland. Of the 150 ships that set out,
                                  only 65 managed to return to Lisbon. </p>

                                  in Northamptonshire in 1526, held this post
                                  during the attempted invasion by the Spanish
                                  Armada. His appointments in Ireland commenced
                                  in 1555 when Mary I appointed him temporary
                                  Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland. In 1575
                                  Fitzwilliam resigned as Lord Deputy and returned
                                  to England owing to ill health. As the governor
                                  of Fotheringay Castle during the incarceration
                                  and subsequent execution of Mary Queen of Scots,
                                  he was said to have shown great respect and
                                  kindness to his prisoner. In 1588 Fitzwilliam
                                  was reappointed Lord Deputy of Ireland. Almost
                                  immediately, he had to deal with the issue
                                  of apprehending Spanish stragglers from the
                                  Armada both on land and off the shores of Ireland. </p>

                                  Mary I. Walsingham's knowledge of foreign affairs,
                                  combined with his many overseas acquaintances,
                                  led to his employment in the area of foreign
                                  secret intelligence under Elizabeth I on his
                                  return to England. In 1573, he was created
                                  joint Secretary of State with Lord Treasurer
                                  Burghley, with special responsibility for foreign
                                  affairs. Walsingham was renowned for his capabilities
                                  in intelligence gathering; his detection of
                                  Babington's plot against the life of Elizabeth
                                  I, in which Mary Queen of Scots was heavily
                                  implicated, led to the latter's execution for
                                  treason in 1586. With many agents in Spain,
                                  Walsingham was aware of the Armada's preparations,
                                  down to minute detail in some cases. He died
                                  in 1590 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral,
                              London. </p>
