							      1630. He was the son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. After his
							      father's execution on 30 January 1649, Charles II was proclaimed
							      king in Scotland. Having fled to France, Charles returned to Scotland
							      in June 1650 and was crowned there in January 1651. However, after
							      his defeat at Cromwell's hands at the Battle of Worcester in September
							      1651, Charles was once against forced into exile, living mainly
							      in the Netherlands. He was invited to return to England in 1660,
							      arriving in London on 29 May 1660. He was finally crowned king of
							      England at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661, but it was publicly
							      proclaimed that he had been king since 30 January 1649, and his
							      regnal years are counted starting on 30 January 1649. The years
							      of the reign of Charles II included the Great Plague of 1665 and
							      the Fire of London in 1666.</p>

								<h2 class="redanddots">'his now Majesty'/James II </h2>
							    <p class="mainbodytext">King James II was born at St James' Palace, London on 14 October
							      1633. He was the younger brother and heir of Charles II. He ascended
							      to the throne on 6 February 1685 and was crowned at Westminster
							      Abbey on 23 April 1685. An admitted Catholic, he put down a Protestant
							      challenge for the crown by James Duke of Monmouth, the illegitimate
							      son of Charles II, at the Battle of Sedgemoor in July 1685. With
							      his first wife Anne Hyde, daughter of Edward Hyde Earl of Clarendon,
							      he had eight children, including the future Mary II and Queen Anne.
							      With his second wife Mary of Modena he had seven children, including
							      James Edward 'The Old Pretender'. Already wary of James' Catholicism,
							      Parliament reacted to the birth of James Edward, a Catholic male
							      heir, by inviting William of Orange, the husband of James II's Protestant
							      daughter Mary, and James' nephew by his elder sister Mary, to take
							      the Crown. James was deposed and left the country. In 1690 his attempt
							      to regain the throne by taking a French army to Ireland failed at
							      the Battle of the Boyne, and he spent the rest of his life in exile
							      in France, where he died in 1701.</p>

							      the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Lawrence became the Member
							      of Parliament for Newport in Cornwall. From May 1662-1675 he was
							      Master of the Robes and in November 1679 he was made First Lord
							      of the Treasury and a Privy Councillor. He was raised to the peerage
							      in 1681, becoming first Viscount Hyde of Kenilworth and then Earl
							      of Rochester. On 16 February 1685, 10 days after the death of Charles
							      II, he was made Lord Treasurer by the new king, James II. His sister
							      Anne Hyde married James Duke of York, the future James II, but died
							      before James succeeded to the throne. Rochester was therefore the
							      brother-in-law of James II and the uncle of Mary II and Queen Anne.
							      His daughter Henrietta married Sir James Scott, grandson of Charles
							      II through his illegitimate son James Duke of Monmouth. </p>

								<h2 class="redanddots">Westminster Abbey </h2>
							    <p class="mainbodytext">Westminster Abbey, or to give it its formal name, The Collegiate
							      Church of St Peter, Westminster, is situated on the northern side
							      of the River Thames in London adjacent to the Palace of Westminster
							      (the Houses of Parliament), which was a royal residence until the
							      reign of Henry VIII. It was named Westminster by the Anglo-Saxons
							      since it was the minster west of St Paul's or the city of London.
							      The date of its original foundation is unknown, but a church and
							      community of Benedictine monks were already in existence when King
							      Edward the Confessor began his abbey building in 1055. This building
							      was finished and consecrated in 1065, a few days before Edward's
							      death. He was buried behind the high altar and his tomb became a
							      shrine visited by pilgrims. Additions and further building work
							      continued under many monarchs, in particular Henry III. In 1502
							      Henry VII began his new Lady Chapel. Under Henry VIII however, the
							      abbey was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
							      The monks were replaced with a dean, 12 prebendaries, minor canons
							      and lay staff. The abbey is a royal peculiar: its officials are
							      appointed by the crown and it is not subject to the rule of the
							      bishop of London, in whose diocese it stands. It has been the place
							      of coronation of nearly all English monarchs, and the burial place
							      of many of them.</p>
