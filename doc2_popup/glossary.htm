                                <p class="bodytext"> King of England 1714-1727.
                                  George I was born on 28 May 1660 in Hanover,
                                  Germany. In 1714, after the death of Queen
                                  Anne, he came to the throne of Great Britain
                                  and Ireland. Although George was only 52nd
                                  in line to the throne, he was the nearest Protestant
                                  heir under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement.
                                  He came to England with little knowledge of
                                  the English language and a lack of understanding
                                  of British affairs, a circumstance that assisted
                                  in the gradual transference of executive power
                                  from the monarch to the  ministers and
                                  cabinet. George was divorced from his wife
                                  Sophia Dorothea of Celle with whom he had one
                                  son, the future George II, and one daughter.
                                  He returned regularly to Hanover, dying there
                                  on 11 June 1727. George was originally buried
                                  at Leinesclosskirche but was reinterred in
                                  1957 at Herrenhausen in Hanover.</p>

                                  his death. Originally a will was concerned
                                  with freehold land while a testament was concerned
                                  with personal goods, but for convenience the
                                  two came to be included in one document. Anyone
                                  with possessions to leave could make a will,
                                  with certain exceptions including the following:</p>

								<li>Married women, unless they had
                                  the consent of their husbands. Control of the
                                  property of a woman passed to her husband upon
                                  marriage. A married woman could bequeath both
                                  the personal goods which she had brought into
                                  the marriage and any clothes the husband had
                                  given her, but only with the consent of her
                                  husband, who also had to be the executor of
                                  the will. This situation did not change until
                                  the Married Women's Property Act of 1882.

                                  the last wishes of the deceased. Until the
                                  Court of Probate was established in 1858, ecclesiastical
                                  courts did the proving as wills were also seen
                                  as religious documents, in which the testator

                                  the traditional industry of Rotherhithe was
                                  shipbuilding. The name is believed to have
