                                <p class="bodytext">A set style of handwriting used in the royal
                                  chancery at Westminster for the engrossing
                                  of royal letters patent, writs and enrolments.
                                  Many government departments had their own set
                                  style of handwriting, which had evolved purely
                                  from a desire for distinctiveness, rather than
                                  concern for legibility. During the Commonwealth
                                  (1649-1660) such set hands were banned, along
                                  with the use of Latin in domestic administrative
                                  documents. Records were to be written in English
                                  and in an ordinary and legible hand. But the
                                  restoration of Charles II also restored all
                                  such set hands, which returned as idiosyncratic
                                  as ever. An Act of Parliament in 1731 (which
                                  came into force in 1733), declared that all
                                  records should be written in a common legible
                                  hand. The only exception was the enrolment
                                  of Acts of Parliament on Parliament rolls,
                                  for which Chancery hand continued to be used
                                  until 1836.</p>

                                  and rolled up. Exchequer rolls are made of
                                  membranes placed in a pile and sewn together

                                  a statute of 1555 parishes were responsible
                                  for repairing roads that ran through them but
                                  the growing volume of traffic made this increasingly
                                  difficult. It was illegal for a toll to be
                                  charged on a public highway without the consent
                                  of the Crown and Parliament. Once consent was
                                  given, all road users could be stopped at gates
                                  across the road and charged a fixed amount
                                  to use the road, determined by the amount of
                                  damage each was considered to cause to the
                                  road. People on their way to church were exempt.
                                  The first turnpike road was
                                  established in 1663 and ran between Wadesmill
                                  and Royston in Hertfordshire. Between 1751
                                  and 1772, 389 new Turnpike Acts were passed.
                                  A trust would be set up to administer the road.</p>

                                  trustees named in each act could vary from
                                  about 30 to over 400, with the average number
                                  in the mid 1700s standing at 200. (Size was
                                  a feature of 18th-century public bodies.) Only
                                  a few trustees would actually attend meetings.
                                  Trustees were generally local men of standing:
                                  noblemen, gentlemen, Members of Parliament,
                                  justices of the peace, influential local landowners
                                  and clergymen. Trustees could appoint surveyors,
                                  arrange for the repair and upkeep of the roads,
                                  erect gates and appoint toll collectors. </p>
