		  </table>				  <p class="mainbodytext">When reading modern text, we generally
                    identify whole words  at a glance. Look at this sentence:</p> 
				  <div class="bodymargin2">
				  <ul>
                    <li><strong>The huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but 
                    the wrod as a wlohe. The oredr of the ltteers in the wrod

                    porbelm.</strong></li> 
                  </ul></div>
                  <p class="mainbodytext">While this way of reading and comprehending whole words at a 
                  glance is very useful in the modern world, it can lead to incomprehension 
                  and mistakes when trying to read documents written in an old 
                  and unfamiliar style of handwriting. </p>
                  <p class="mainbodytext">Be prepared to tackle an old document letter by letter if necessary. 
                  If you cannot identify a letter, leave it out, or put in a suggestion 
                  of what you think it is, perhaps with a question mark by it. 
                  Do a few more lines and then go back to see if you can now identify 
                  the letter. Or see if you have already come across it and understood 
                  it somewhere else in the document.</p>

					<p class="mainbodytext">Knowing the background to the document will help enormously 
                  with reading the handwriting. Many types of documents contain 
                  standard phrases or formulas. It is much harder to read a document 
                  if you do not know what kind of document it is. If you know 
                  the phrases which are likely to appear in a particular document, 
                  you will be able to read them easily when they appear. You can 
                  then use the phrases which you are certain about to help decipher 
                  other words.</p>

					<p class="mainbodytext">When copying a document always transcribe: this is when you 
                  retain the original spellings. Do not translate, this is when 
                  the words are changed into modern spelling. When you expand 
                  a word which was abbreviated in the original text (see <a href="#abbreviations">abbreviation 
                  section</a>) put the letters that you have added in square brackets 
                  [ ]. This way, when you no longer have the original in front 
                  of you, you will know which letters appear in the original document 
                  and which ones you have added.</p>

                  <p class="mainbodytext">Spelling in English was not standardised
                    until the 18th century.  Before then, words were often spelt
                    phonetically (as they sound) and in local dialects. Vowel
                    sounds in particular could be written in a variety of different
                    ways, depending on how the writer said the word. A writer
                    would often spell the same word in different ways in one
                    document.</p> 
                    <p class="mainbodytext">Archaic words: You may find that
                      you have transcribed a word perfectly, and yet still not
                      know what it says. In this case it is important to look
                      in a good dictionary, as the word may be one which has
                      fallen out of modern use. Often however it is merely a
                      matter of saying the word out loud - although you should
                      take your regional dialect into consideration if you decide
                      to try this! Look at this word:</p>
                    <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>belhaus</strong></p>
                    <p class="mainbodytext">Out of context, you might think this is a bell tower. However, 
                    it appeared in an <a href="doc2_popup/glossary.htm#Inventory" onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow('doc2_popup/glossary.htm#Inventory','popup','600','500','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue">inventory</a><img src="images/icons/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens in a new window" width="16" height="16" /> 
                    of someone's kitchen, so it had to be something which the 
                    average person would have in their kitchen. Try saying it 
                    out loud. The word in modern spelling is: </p>
                    <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>bellows</strong></p>
                    <p class="mainbodytext">Also take into consideration the following:</p>
                  <div class="bodymargin">
				  <ul>
                    <li> Use of <strong>y</strong> for <strong>i</strong>,
                      for example m<em>y</em>ne = mine. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Interchangeable <strong>i</strong> and<strong> j</strong>. <em>I</em>ohn
                      = John. Ma<em>i</em>est<em>ie</em> = Majesty</em>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Interchangeable <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong>,
                      such as e<em>u</em>er = ever. <em>v</em>nto = unto </li>
                    <li>Long 's'. Don't get long <strong>s</strong> and <strong>f</strong> mixed
                      up. The 'f'  will have a cross stroke, even if it's hardly
                      noticeable,  and the context will make it clear whether
                      it is a long  's' or an 'f'. Writers would often use both
                      long and short 's', sometimes even in the same word.</li>
                    <li>Use of a single consonant where you would find two in 
                      modern English, such as <em>al</em> - all.</li>
                    <li>Use of two consonants where you would find one in modern 
                      English, such as <em>allways</em> - always. </li>
                    <li>Minims. A minim is a single downstroke of the pen. An 
                      'i' is therefore one minim, an 'n' or 'u' is made up of 
                      two minims, and a 'm' three. In modern handwriting, where 
                      each letter is individually formed and the 'i's are dotted, 
                      these letters do not cause any problems of comprehension. 
                      But in old handwriting, particularly in <a href="doc2_popup/glossary.htm#Cursive" onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow('doc2_popup/glossary.htm#Cursive','popup','600','500','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue">cursive hands<img src="images/icons/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens in a new window" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> 
                      , where the writer was writing very quickly and possibly 
                      not forming the joining strokes, they can be very hard to 
                      tell apart.</li>
                  </ul>
          </div>
				 <p class="mainbodytext"><img src="images/wherex_01.jpg" alt="minim minimum mum" width="417" height="30" />                  </p>
				 <p class="mainbodytext">One way to deal with this, if it is not clear what the letters 
                  are, is to count the minims and work out the combinations of 
                  letters they could represent. From the context of the rest of 
                  the sentence, you should be able to work out the word. Use your 
                  common sense - even if a word really does look like <em>thmg</em>, 
                  no such word exists, so it must be <em>thing</em>.</p>

                 <p class="mainbodytext">Readers of old documents will very quickly come across what 
                    look like very strange squiggles and dashes above or in between 
                    letters. These are actually abbreviation marks - they have 
                    been put in by the writer to show that he or she has deliberately 
                    omitted one or more letters. This was done for two reasons 
                    - for speed of writing, and to save space on the page, as 
                    parchment was very expensive. </p>
                    <p class="mainbodytext">Abbreviations were standard across Europe, and any educated 
                    person would have understood them at a glance. A modern equivalent 
                    would be this abbreviation sign:</p>
                   <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>@</strong> which means 'at',
                     and is recognised by everyone today.</p>

                        or wavy line written over the preceding vowel. The context

                  <p class="bodytext">It is worth noting that the location of the dash or wavy
                    line may not always follow this rule. The author of the document
