After his father's execution on 30 January 1649, Charles II was proclaimed king in Scotland. Having fled to France, Charles returned to Scotland in June 1650 and was crowned there in January 1651. However, after his defeat at Cromwell's hands at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, Charles was once against forced into exile, living mainly in the Netherlands. He was invited to return to England in 1660, arriving in London on 29 May 1660. He was finally crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661, but it was publicly proclaimed that he had been king since 30 January 1649, and his regnal years are counted starting on 30 January 1649. The years of the reign of Charles II included the Great Plague of 1665 and the Fire of London in 1666.</p>

                                  Mary was born at St James' Palace on 30 April
                                  1662. She was the daughter of James II and
                                  Anne Hyde. In 1677 she married her cousin William,
                                  son of William II, Stadtholder of the Netherlands,
                                  and Mary Henrietta, the daughter of Charles
                                  I of England. After the Catholic James II was

                                  ascended the throne of England on 13 February
                                  1689. Mary was the actual heir but William
                                  insisted on being king rather than consort.
                                  Mary died of smallpox at Kensington Palace
                                  on 28 December 1694 and was buried in Westminster

                                  March 1702. He was buried at Westminster Abbey.
                                  Since William and Mary had no children, they
                                  were succeeded by Mary's sister, Anne. </p>
