                                  of the initial bill of complaint, followed
                                  by the answer, and sometimes further replications
                                  and rejoinders. The answer was a written statement
                                  by the defendant refuting the complaint.</p>

								<h2 class="redanddots">Bill of complaint</h2>
                                <p class="mainbodytext">Star Chamber pleadings
                                  generally consisted of the bill of complaint,
                                  the answer, the replications and the rejoinder.
                                  The bill of complaint was a written petition
                                  explaining the plaintiff's grievances and the
                                  wrong he claimed the defendant had done him
                                  and the damages he had sustained. Bills often
                                  exaggerated the violence in order to make the
                                  case a matter of public disorder (and therefore
                                  a matter for the royal courts) rather than
                                  a private complaint.</p>

								<h2 class="redanddots">Henry VIII</h2>
                                <p class="mainbodytext">Henry VIII was born at Greenwich on 28 June
                                  1491. He was the second son of Henry VII and
                                  Elizabeth of York. His elder brother Prince
                                  Arthur died in 1502, making Henry heir to the
                                  throne, to which he succeeded on 21 April 1509.
                                  Desperate for a male heir to secure the Tudor
                                  succession, Henry VIII had six wives. During
                                  the English Reformation Henry became head of
                                  the Church in England, repudiating papal supremacy,
                                  and closed down the monasteries. The monastic
                                  lands were sold off and the revenues went to
                                  the Crown. Henry died at Whitehall in London
                                  on 28 January 1547, and was buried in St George's
                                  Chapel in Windsor Castle.</p>

                                <p class="mainbodytext">The Star Chamber was effectively the king's
                                  council sitting as a tribunal to enforce law
                                  and order. It was named after the room in the
                                  palace of Westminster where the council met,
                                  which had a blue ceiling painted with gold
                                  stars. The Star Chamber became a separate court
                                  of law after 1485. It investigated cases of
                                  public disorder, official corruption, municipal
                                  and trade disputes, fraud, and disputes over
                                  the enclosure of land.</p>
                                <p class="mainbodytext">Star Chamber cases frequently allege <em>public</em> disorder,
                                  such as riots, forcible entry and assault,
                                  but many of them were in fact <em>private</em> disputes
                                  about rights to property. After the Star Chamber
                                  was abolished in 1641 its records were stored
                                  in two places. Those kept in the Star Chamber
                                  itself are now at The National Archives. Those
                                  stored at the Star Chamber Office at Gray's
                                  Inn have not survived.</p>
